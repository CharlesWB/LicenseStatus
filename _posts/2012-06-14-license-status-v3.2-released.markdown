I've released v3.2 of License Status with these changes:

* You can now turn on and off columns in the detail view.
* Trying out a new application icon. It's Metro inspired so it doesn't exactly fit with the typical Windows 7/XP icons, but it's a lot easier to draw. 
* The class library, LicenseManager.dll, is now using .NET 4.0 like the rest of the application. 
* Various internal changes.
