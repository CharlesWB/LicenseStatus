It's been a while, but I've finally taken the time to upgrade License Status to use .NET Framework 4.0. Functionally nothing has changed, but visually you should notice that the font display is [sharper](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/text/archive/2009/08/24/wpf-4-0-text-stack-improvements.aspx). 

[Previous versions](http://sourceforge.net/projects/licensestatus/files/Past%20Releases/) which only require .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 are still available.
